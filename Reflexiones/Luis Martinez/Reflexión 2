This week I wanted to talk about the issue of affordance, when we talked about this the first few weeks I felt that this was a very important issue in the software industry and interface design.

Actually since I was 13 years old I have liked to learn to use numerous programs or soft wares of different functions. And I've always been struck by the fact that like most programs that succeed despite having competition, they often win for what I did not know at that time was affordance.

I love the idea that as a programmer and interface designer you find out and experiment with the users how to show them, the features they need without confusing or make them feel strange especially when things do not work the same on a screen as in the world 2d.

I think a point in favor of the software companies or product design to create an affordance in their products so that the user may already know how the product works, I find it really annoying that every time you learn a new program you have to take hours of courses in simply how to use their interface because many times these are not designed or thought for their target user. We don’t need more time to learn things from the interface than in technical things we want to do.

I will never forget how it was to teach to my grandmother how to make a call on her new Android, she was so used to having physical buttons to mark, that when she saw them in 2D she simply did not know how to press them or how much force to apply to the screen.
